## About 
This is an app created with Amazon in mind. There are two versions. The first version is the "Customer View" version. Here, the user uses the app like Amazon. They can see what items are available, the name of the item, type of item, price of item, and how many are currently in stock. They are able to make purchases by specifying the ID and the amount. Once their purchase is made, the table updates to show that a purchase has been made. 

In the second version, the app is made from the "Manager View." Here, the user is able to check what is currently in stock, as well as viewing low inventory, replenishing inventory, and adding new items. Similarily to the Customer View version, the tables here also update to reflect any restocking and addition of items. Once the user adds a new product into the database, MySQL Workbench will also reflect the additions in their database.
